# My Contribution to the WOW Project

Hey everyone, this is the readme for my part of the WOW group project.

My name's Sergio, and I was responsable for creating the main structure and key navigation pages for our website. The main goal was to build these pages using only pure HTML, which was a pretty cool challenge.

### The Pages I Made

* **`index.html` (The Home Page):** This is the first page everyone sees. It introduces the project, lists all of our team members, and explains what each person did.

* **`wow.html` (The Wonders Hub):** This page is like the main menu for the wonders. It has pictures and links to all the individual wonder pages that my teammates (Joldrich, Khaliza, Samiya, and Mikhail) worked on.

* **`bibli.html` (The Bibliography):** Super important page for school projects! This lists all the websites and books we used for research and gives credit to the image sources. There also a little feedback form on there.

### Technical Stuff (How My Pages Work)

To get the two-column layout with the sidebar, I used a big `<table>` on each page. It's an old-school way to do it but it works great without any CSS.

All the colors, fonts, and text sizes are done with HTML attributes inside tags like `<body bgcolor="...">` and `<font size="4">`. I couldn't use any CSS, so this was the only way to make the pages look nice and have a consistent feel.

### How to View My Work

Just open `index.html` in a web browser. From there you can click through to the other pages I made and see how they link to the rest of the project.
